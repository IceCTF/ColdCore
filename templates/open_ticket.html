<h2>Open a Trouble Ticket</h2>
<p>If you're having an issue with the platform or your account, you should open
a trouble ticket. You should also submit a ticket if a problem is broken. Please
don't submit a ticket if you're stuck on a problem, and need a hint &endash; if
that is the case, please contact the author of the problem on IRC.</p>
<p>The issue summary should be a one-sentence description of the problem you
are having. You should elaborate on the issue in the description field.</p>
